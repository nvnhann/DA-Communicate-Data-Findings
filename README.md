# Project: Communicate Data Findings

## Project Overview

### Introduction
This project consists of two parts, highlighting the significance of data visualization in the data analysis process.

#### Part I - Exploratory Data Visualization
- Use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a dataset.
- Begin with single-variable plots, progressing to multi-variable visualizations.

#### Part II - Explanatory Data Visualization
- Create a concise presentation showcasing interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in your dataset.
- Transform exploratory visualizations into polished, explanatory visuals.

### Why This Project?
Data visualization is a crucial skill in the data analysis process, aiding both exploration and communication of findings.

- **Exploratory Data Visualization**: Helps in understanding patterns and relationships in data, guiding statistical analyses and conclusions. May reveal further data-cleaning needs.
- **Explanatory Data Visualization**: Crucial for communicating findings effectively. Enhances understanding of design principles and improves visualization interpretation skills.

### Learning Objectives
Post completion, you will be able to:
- Enhance statistical analysis with visualizations for deeper data understanding.
- Select appropriate visualizations for dataset exploration.
- Use design principles to create effective visuals for audience communication.

### Submission Instructions
- Develop your project locally or in the classroom workspace.
- Submission options: Directly from the workspace or as a zip file.

### Local Environment (Recommended: Project Workspace)
- Python 3 environment with Jupyter Notebooks.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Code Quality
### Success Criteria
- **Functional Code**: No errors (warnings acceptable if not due to poor coding).
- **Clean Code**: Includes comments, docstrings, and avoids repetitive code.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Success Criteria
- **Systematic Exploration**: Use a series of varied visualizations.
- **Seven (7) Exploratory Visualizations**: Covering univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots.
- **Required Charts**: Histogram (univariate), Scatterplots and Box Plots (bivariate), Facet Plot (multivariate).
- **Annotations and Scales**: Relevant annotations, appropriate scales, and axis labels.

### Documentation
- **Questions and Observations**: Regularly documented throughout the report.
- **Assumptions and Questions**: Clearly stated for each exploration category.
- **Findings**: Described after each plot/set of plots.
- **Tip**: Use "Question-Visualization-Observations" framework.

## Explanatory Data Analysis
### Success Criteria
- **Narrative Flow**: Logical organization with a clear overarching question or theme.
- **Context**: Provide background for the dataset analyzed.
- **Key Insights and Findings**: Supported by visualizations from exploratory analysis.
- **Polished Visuals**: Clear axes, labels, and annotations.
